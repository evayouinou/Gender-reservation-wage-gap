# To what extent the reservation wage has an impact on the gender wage gap across the wage distribution?

## Abstract

In this paper, we use French administrative data to document the gender reservation wage gap across
the wage distribution. On average, the residual wage gap when including the reservation wage in the
controls is -1.1%. The difference in reservation wage between men and women is explaining around 54%
of the adjusted gender wage gap. However, this result is heterogeneous, going from -3% to 1.5%. Using
quantile treatment effects, we found that, including the reservation wage, the gap is closed at the top of
the distribution whereas it is still large in the middle of the distribution, meaning that the role of the
reservation wage is increasing across the wage distribution.
